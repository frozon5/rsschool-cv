I am Eimantas, and I live in Klaipėda, my passion in computer sciences
started from very basic things - games. After some time in my life I
began to think differently about computers, not just like a gaming object
but also a bit deeper into it. I started to think how computer works,
what parts it has and how to build it from parts, next thing I was
repairing them. After that I already have chosen a different path,
but I did not give up on my dreams to link my life with computers and
found a way to start programming and gain interesting skills and knowledge.
Today I am second year student in informatics at Klaipėda State University
of Applied Sciences. Before this I studied in Klaipėda university, there
I got my bachelors degree in Ecology and Environmental Management. After
that I tried to find a suitable job and found it in the s, but I
realized that computers will always be in my heart. Generally I am
organized and very systematic. I like when everything around me is in
some sort of system, because I do not like chaos near me. Of course, it
is just easier to do everything, when the environment is well organized.
Also, I am a friendly person, and I easily adapt to new surroundings.
I like to read news about the latest technologies and always be up to
date, and I am trying to follow what's happening around the world. My
main goal is to have a stable challenging and rewarding job after the
studies that will help me realize my dreams. As for dreams, it's to see
upcoming future, as I'm very much interested in the progress of technology,
also I would love to see Northern Scandinavia like Norway, I do like
nature and culture there.
